### Four Elements

> This project is about the game Four Elements with similar to Fire boy & Water girl story. The game will be developed using pure(vanilla) JavaScript. The MVP would be a working demo of Fire boy & Water girl and is expected to be done till 5th of September.

Expected game mechanics:
> Every element has his own type of surface - which can either be neutral, or even somehow boost him. The goal for the level - to collect all coins/diamonds, or to reach the exit. Also, additional types of surfaces - buttons, gates, etc...
Probably, to be used - graphics done by Vlad

 -  Three type of surfaces - neutral, friendly, enemy 
 -  Coins/diamonds to be picked
 -  Gravity
- One character ready.
